# BARE — Bare App Replaces Excess

Native SPA Scaffold based on Web Standards.

Framework-free, lightweight, 100 % native, zero dependencies, just plain vanilla JavaScript.

A Single Page Application without background noise.

## Goal
This SPA demo has one main goal: to make you think about whether you really still need a framework for an SPA in the future.

## How it works
Read more in the SPA itself. And of course, the truth is in the code.

## Usage
### Demo
A running demo is available at: https://bare.asderix.com

### Adapt
This no framework oder library. Read the code an let you inspire. Of course you can download the code.
and delete what you don't need. Adjust what needs to be changed. And then: start programming. Happy coding your native SPA!

#### Run locally
The browser don't load ES-Module via file:/// because of CORS. To run the static SPA locally you need a webserver.
With Python it is quiet easy. Open your terminal, go to the directory of the SPA an run: python -m http.server
Now you can open the SPA at http://localhost:8000
